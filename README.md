## Design Choices

  * The relationship between Users and Tasks is one-to-many
  * Used user id to related the two entities
  * Transformed user id to it's respective email address so the id is never exposed to the user
  * Handled most of the logic in the Task Controller file
  * Validated 15 minute increments in task.ex file
  * None of the inputs fields can ever be empty
  * User email must exist in the database in order for a task to be assigned to them
